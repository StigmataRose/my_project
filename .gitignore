# Directories to ignore
# ---------------------

# Build output directory:
# This directory is where CMake generates build files, object files, and executables.
# It should always be ignored as its contents are generated from source.
build/

# IDE-specific directories:
# If you are using Visual Studio Code, a '.vscode/' directory might be created
# for project settings and user preferences. This should typically be ignored
# as it's specific to your local setup and not part of the core project.
.vscode/

visage/
# Temporary or local working files:
# These files appear to be temporary notes or scratchpads. They are usually
# not part of the final project source code and should be ignored.
readme.txt
working.txt
workingcpp.txt

# Files that should NOT be ignored (typically tracked in Git):
# -------------------------------------------------------------
# CMakeLists.txt    # Essential for defining your CMake project build
# README.md         # Project documentation
# index.html        # Web page source (if this is a web project component)
# main.cpp          # Main C++ source file
